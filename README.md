## Heart-Disease
A Predictive Model for Heart Attack Risk 

A heart attack, also known as a myocardial infarction, is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, which is one of the leading causes of death worldwide at all ages. A heart attack typically occurs when a blood clot built-up inside the walls of coronary arteries and obstructs blood flow to the heart muscle, resulting oxygen and nutrients supply to the heart muscle cells severely reduced. As a result, the affected muscle cells begin to die, and the heart can become weakened and even damaged, leading to potentially life-threatening complications. According to the American Heart Association, a heart attack occurs every 40 seconds in the United States. About 805,000 people has a heart attack every year in the United States. An estimated 605,000 of these are a first-time heart attacks, and about 1 in 5 heart attacks are silent, meaning that damage to the heart muscles has occurred without any noticeable symptoms of heart attack. The purpose of this study is to analyze major factors as well as to determine their relationships with the risk of heart attack to prevent and reduce the incidence of heart attack.
